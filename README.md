~ Handles NoSuchElement test failures: In runtime replaces failed control with a new value that matches the best and performs an action with replaced control successfully;

~ Can be easily configured by just wrapping your Selenium driver with SelfHealingDriver. Usage of ML algorithm for page changes identification will help to find controls (new locators) for updated pages and fix your tests in a runtime.
